 *
 * Implement the Queue abstraction using a fixed sized array.  This
 * array based implementation will dynamically allocate a new block of
 * memory once the current allocation becomes full.  The new block is
 * double in size of the old.  Thus push at the end of the queue
 * can be O(1) in most cases, but will take O(n) copies as well as a
 * memory allocation if it needs to grow. In order to make
 * queue operations efficient for both enqueue on the back and dequeue
 * on the front of the queue, we have to now treat the array ov
 * values as a circular buffer.
