 *
 * Implement the Queue abstraction using a linked list of dynamically
 * allocated node items.  The linked list based implementation creates
 * new nodes dynamically when items are pushed onto the queue, and
 * deletes these nodes when the value is popped back off.  The Node
 * structure defined in the Node.hpp header file is used by this queue
 * and is private to this queue member functions.  We use the back of
 * the linked list to enqueue items onto the queue, and the front of
 * the list to dequeue items from.  This is the natural interpretation
 * of the queue, and since we are only removing from the front, both
 * enqueue and dequeue are constant time O(1) operations.
