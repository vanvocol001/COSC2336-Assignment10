 * Implement the Queue abstraction using a fixed sized array.  This
 * array based implementation will dynamically allocate a new block of
 * memory once the current allocation becomes full.  The new block is
 * double in size of the old.  Thus push at the end of the queue
 * can be O(1) in most cases, but will take O(n) copies as well as a
 * memory allocation if it needs to grow.  In order to make
 * queue operations efficient for both enqueue on the back and dequeue
 * on the front of the queue, we have to now treat the array ov
 * values as a circular buffer.

 *
 * Concrete implementation of Queue abstraction using an array based
 * implementation.  We maintain an array (a block of memory) to hold
 * the values currently in the queue.  To make both enqueue and dequeue
 * operations efficient, we treat the array as a circular buffer of items,
 * so both putting items on the end of the queue and taking items from the
 * front can be constant time O(1) operations.
